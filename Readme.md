## **üöÄ Getting Started**

### **1\. Arduino IDE Setup**

1. **Download and Install Arduino IDE.**  
2. Add ESP32 Board Manager URL in File \> Preferences:  
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package\_esp32\_index.json  
3. **Install ESP32 Boards** via Tools \> Board \> Boards Manager....  
4. **Select Board:** Tools \> Board \> ESP32 Arduino \> Adafruit ESP32-S3 Feather.

### **2\. USB Connection and Setup**

**For detailed Mac-specific USB connection and upload instructions, see [USB Connection Guide](AlertTX-1/docs/usb-connection-guide.md)**

1. **Connect ESP32-S3 Feather to Mac** via USB-C cable
2. **Install drivers** if needed (Silicon Labs CP210x)
3. **Install Arduino CLI** - Use `brew install arduino-cli` or download from GitHub
4. **Verify connection** - Yellow CHG LED should illuminate
5. **Configure Arduino CLI** - Install ESP32 board support

### **3\. Library Installation**

**Libraries are automatically managed by Arduino CLI. Required libraries will be installed automatically during the first build.**

If you need to manually install libraries:
```bash
# Install required libraries via Arduino CLI
arduino-cli lib install "Adafruit GFX Library"
arduino-cli lib install "Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library"
arduino-cli lib install "PubSubClient"
```

### **4\. Project Files**

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AlertTX-1.git  
   cd AlertTX-1

   (Replace with your actual repository URL)  
2. **Open in Arduino IDE:** Open AlertTX-1.ino.

### **5\. Build and Upload**

```bash
# Navigate to the AlertTX-1 directory
cd AlertTX-1

# Generate ringtone data and build project (recommended)
make upload

# Or step by step:
make ringtones  # Generate ringtone data
make build      # Build Arduino project
make upload     # Upload to device (includes build)

# Monitor serial output
make monitor
```

**Alternative**: Use Arduino CLI directly:
```bash
# Compile and upload
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:adafruit_feather_esp32s3_reversetft .
arduino-cli upload --fqbn esp32:esp32:adafruit_feather_esp32s3_reversetft .
```

### **6\. Configuration**

Edit `AlertTX-1/src/config/settings.h` to set your Wi-Fi credentials, MQTT broker details, and hardware pin assignments.

## **üéÆ Usage**

### **Power Management**

The Alert TX-1 defaults to a low-power sleep mode. Perform a **long press** (hold for at least 1 second) on the designated power button to wake it up and enter active mode. It will return to sleep after INACTIVITY\_TIMEOUT\_MS of inactivity.

### **Navigation**

Use **Button A/B** to navigate up/down through menus and **Button C** to select items or go back.

### **Receiving Sentry.io Alerts**

Once connected to Wi-Fi and MQTT, the Alert TX-1 subscribes to the topic defined in settings.h (alerttx1/messages by default). When the Beeper-Service publishes a Sentry.io alert to this topic, the device will wake up, display the message, trigger the LED, and play a ringtone.

### **Ringtones**

The device includes 14 built-in ringtones with optimized binary format. Add custom RTTTL files to `data/ringtones/` and run `make ringtones` to include them. Access the "Ringtones" menu to select and preview sounds.

### **BeeperHero Game**

Access the "Games" menu and select "BeeperHero." Use buttons A, B, C to hit notes as they scroll down, following the rhythm of the selected ringtone.

## **üîß Customization**

* **Ringtones:** Add RTTTL files to `data/ringtones/` and run `make ringtones`  
* **UI Components:** Create custom components using the React-like framework  
* **Game Difficulty:** Modify game settings in `src/config/settings.h`  
* **Hardware Integration:** Extend with sensors, displays, or other peripherals
